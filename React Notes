### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a React Project Using Vite

1. Install Node.js (Version 20):  
   First, download and install Node.js (v20.x.x) from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). This ensures that you have npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

2. Create a Folder:  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and create a folder named "react":
  
   mkdir react
   

3. Navigate to Your Folder:  
   Use the `cd` command to move into the directory where you want to create the project:
  
   cd \path\to\react
  

4. Create a New Vite Project:  
   Run the following command to set up a new Vite-powered React project:
   
   npm create vite@latest


5. Confirm:  
   If prompted, press "Y" to confirm the installation.

6. Name Your Project Folder:  
   You'll be prompted to give a name to the folder where the project will reside.

7. Name Your Project:  
   Enter a name for your new React project.

8. Select Framework:  
   When asked to select a framework, choose **React**.

9. Select Variant:  
   Select JavaScript (or TypeScript, depending on your preference).

10. Enter the Project Directory:  
    Once the setup is complete, move into the newly created folder:
 
    cd react
 

11. Open Visual Studio Code:  
    Run the following command to open the project in VS Code:
    
    code .
   

12. Open Terminal:  
    Inside VS Code, open the integrated terminal by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.

13. Install Dependencies:  
    Install all the necessary project dependencies by running:
  
    npm install
 

14. Run the Development Server:  
    To start your Vite development server, run the following command:
    
    npm run dev
 

15. Open the Development Server:  
    After running the command, press "Ctrl" and click the link that appears in the terminal to open your project in the browser.



### React Boilerplate with ES7+ Snippets

1. Install ES7 and ES7+ Extensions:  
   To speed up your development workflow, install the **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension provides a boilerplate for various React components.

   You can install it from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets).

2. Create a Functional Component:  
   Use the `rfce` shortcut to quickly create a React Functional Component boilerplate:
   - "rfce" stands for "React Functional Component with Export". After typing it, press **Enter**, and the boilerplate will be generated automatically.

   Ensure that your file names start with a **capital letter**, as this is a common convention for React components.

3. App Component:  
   All components will eventually be rendered within the `App.js` file, so anything you want to display on the console or in the browser should be reflected in that file. 
  If you create additional components (such as `Navbar`), you must **import** and include them in the `App.js` file:
   
   import Navbar from './Navbar';
   
   function App() {
       return (
           <div>
               <Navbar />
           </div>
       );
   }

   export default App;
